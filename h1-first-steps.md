    ## Episode 94: Mariposa Botnet

    94 Mariposa Botnet
      In this podcast, Chris Davis, a cybersecurity professional and the founder of Hyas, shares some tales of his experiences stopping different kinds of cyber threats throughout his years of work in the field.
    
      Story 1: Curador
    In the first story, Davis, decided to dig deeper into a hacker called Curador. Curador had made a big named for himself compromising e-commerce sites and constantly bragging about stealing and publishing people’s personal credit card information. The ego of this           hacker motivated Davis, to take him down which he managed to do by going through different network server logs. He ended up collaborating with the UK federal government and police, finally taking down Curador, an 18-year-old boy from Wales. Despite the crimes, Davis       still found himself feeling a mix of pity and empathy for the boy, as he understood the challenges of growing up in a less privileged environment.
    
      Story 2: Mariposa botnet
    Continuing from there, Davis moved around working different jobs. He worked for Dell in Texas and start-up company for his friend, however, after awhile ended up in Ottawa where he founded Defence Intelligence, a company focusing on defence and cybersecurity. 
    A challenge he didn’t see coming was the Mariposa botnet. He first encountered this botnet through unusual patterns in the network server logs due to a surge in traffic to normally unused domains. Investigating the activity further, he realized that there were             multiple different botnets working under the same umbrella. Suspecting that this had something to do with malicious activity, he analysed control server logs which eventually took him back to Spain. From there on Davis worked with Panda Security, a Spanish cyber           security company, to take down the people in charge of the Mariposa botnet. This was so far the biggest botnet he has worked with reaching to about 14 million users.
    
      Story 3: French Infrastructure Attack
    After running Defense Intelligence, Davis founded and sold companies till he finally established Hyas about 6 years ago. Hyas is a threat detection company, they concentrate on the infrastructure which is used by hackers to actively identify and prevent cyber-attacks      from happening.
    While working in Hyas, Davis, once again had an incident where he noticed unusual traffic spikes, which this time were targeting critical infrastructure in France. Infrastructure, which was affected included banks, nuclear plants etc. Despite, reaching out to the          federal government of France and trying to contact them through FBI as well, France lacked in response to the cyber attack and Davis didn’t hear back from them.

    My own comments: I think that the podcast episode was really interesting! I struggled summarizing it into what I hoped for detail wise, but if anyone wants to know more about these types of attacks and the specific ways they were taken down I very much do recommend        listening to this.
