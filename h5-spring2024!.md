### c) Choose a password manager. (This subtask b does not require tests with a computer). First, create a short list of some password managers; then pick one. Explain:
- What threats does it protect against?
- What information is encrypted, what's not?
- What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
- Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
- How is the data protected?
### d) Demonstrate the use of a password manager, the one you picked in previous subtask.
