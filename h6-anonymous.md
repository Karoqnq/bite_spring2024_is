[Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/07/7-things-you-should-know-about-tor)

- Not only used by criminals, can be used to circumvent censorships, anonymity, secure communications and more.
- Tor is open-source
- Easy to use
- Faster than you'd think
- Not foolproof, always use tor browser bundle as it's the safest option. Do not add any add ons to it.

- Basically a modified version of firefox
- Intention is to allow unrestricted and anonymous communication over the Internet.
- Allows everyone to connect to websites that might be blocked, communicate business privately and so much more, however, it is also used to commit crimes.
- Initially developed by the US government in 2002, presently not controlled by them.
- Not controlled by any one entity rather open to improvements from anyone with the skills to do so.
- Data is layered with curve cryptography.
- Sending data over Tor is like an onion with layers.
- FBI succeeded to take down criminals regarding child pornography services due to a exploit of Firefox. This got fixed soon after.
- Tor should be left the way it is as that's the most secure. Most times users do the mistakes of changing things or allowing location services which ends up with possibly identifying the user.
- Man in the middle attacks used to bypass security.
- To find true IPs, sometimes emails are infected with tracking codes. If the email allows HTML a special tracking script runs and the IP will be obtained.
- The same can be done but with documents / files, worse when document is opened but more known not to open suspicious documents.

### a) Install TOR browser and access TOR network (.onion addresses). (Explain in detail how you installed it, and how you got access to TOR).

I went onto this link on Tero's webpage

From there on I downloaded TOR bundle for Linux as that's what we use on our VM.

I extracted the bundle and by clicking tor-browser the browser opened.

I went to the site Ahmia.fi from where I clicked on the Onion service and it took me to the darknet.

### b) Browse TOR network, find, take screenshots and comment

#### search engine for onion sites
- I used Ahmia as seen above


#### marketplace

Seemed like it had been around for awhile, I think I also came across it when we were surfing during class. Selling quite "normal" illegal things such as guns, drugs and credit cards.


#### forum

Interesting! A forum mixed with a market place which I hadn't seen prior but kind of made sense.


#### a site for a well known organization that has a physical street address in the real world

I think the easiest official site to find, I found it through the dark net Pug who has a lot of interesting links but I'm a bit too anxious to go clicking around.
